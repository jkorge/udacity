**Object Destructuring and Tempalte Literals Exercise**
---
Let's get some quick practice with object destructuring and template literals.

This isn't too challenging. You'll have one user object that you need to destructure and then use that to create some strings. 

In the end you want the cards to look identical to each other. Like this...

**Getting started:**
---
The starter code for this is in this repository on GitHub.

There are several files in this repo, but the ONLY one you should edit is the scripts.js file.

Don't edit any HTML or CSS.

Inside the scripts.js file, you'll see a function called destructureExercise().

Inside this function, completely destructure the user object that's provided. Every key should be accounted for.

After that, use your destructured variables to create a name and bio string. The name is just the first and last name. The bio should match the exisiting card you can see.

DON'T EDIT ANY OTHER PART OF THIS FUNCTION!

All you need to worry about it destructuring the object and creating a name and bio variable. The rest of the function uses some methods we haven't learned yet, so don't edit those or the function may not work.

**Tips:**
---
Notice that I haven't asked you to do anything with the profilePic key-value pair. If you destructure the object completely and accurately, then the function will take care of that for you. In fact, if you don't destructure the object completely, the code will thrown an error. Remember to make sure you include profilePic in your destructuring.

Also notice that there's an array in there. If you want some extra practice, destructure that array before you create your strings. You don't have to, but it couldn't hurt to get some practice.
